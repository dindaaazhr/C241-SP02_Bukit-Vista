# [C241-SP02] Bukit Vista - Similar Property Clustering
Bangkit Academy Batch 1 2024 launched a new capstone project track called Company Track. Here various companies can propose cases so that students can create solutions that can solve these problems. Similar Property Clustering is one of the cases carried out by a property management company called Bukit Vista. In this case we are required to develop a property clustering model that allows to recommend properties that are similar to each other. The main focus is to identify similar patterns and characteristics among various properties, property details, unit details, booking prices details, etc.
